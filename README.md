# Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.
## Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

## tool am useing for this task !
- [kaspersky](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [password metet](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/)

## sample passwords am used for this testing
 1. jibinjoby
 2. jibinjobyP
 3. jibinjoby1234
 4. jibinjobyP1234@!

 ## here is the output when i test it 
 ### for `jibinjoby`
 > in kaspersky
 - ![image](/screenshots/kas_one.png)
 > in password meter
 - ![image](/screenshots/meter_one.png)
 > in bitwarden
 - ![imaage](/screenshots/bit.one)

 ### for `jibinjobyP`
 > in kaspersky
 - ![image](/screenshots/kas_two.png)
 > in password meter
 - ![image](/screenshots/meter_two.png)
 > in bitwarden
 - ![imaage](/screenshots/bit_two.png)

 ### for `jibinjoby1234`
 > in kaspersky
 - ![image](/screenshots/kas_three.png)
 > in password meter
 - ![image](/screenshots/meter_three.png)
 > in bitwarden
 - ![imaage](/screenshots/bit_three.png)
 
  ### for `jibinjobyP1234@!`
 > in kaspersky
 - ![image](/screenshots/kas_four.png)
 > in password meter
 - ![image](/screenshots/meter_four.png)
 > in bitwarden
 - ![imaage](/screenshots/bit_four.png)

 ## my observation 
 - when i use `jibinjoby` the output of it is very poor like its very weak easy to crack so "dont use only letter in password"
 - then `jibinjobyP` here am add capital letter to my password but its also out put very poor easy to crack but "better that `jibinjoby`
 - afer that just add numbers to it like `jibinjoby1234` then the out put little better earlier but `not recommanded`
 - then am add some speacial character and also mix capital letter and numbers `jibinjobyP1234@!` its out is "good strong password" its mean when you use mixed lower , capital , numbers, and special character to password its would be great and not easy to crack it
